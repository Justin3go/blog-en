# It's Getting Cold, and Your Laptop Needs to Keep Warm Too

A few days ago, I suddenly wanted to play games, so I took my gaming notebook that I hadn't used for a while, plugged in the power, clicked to start, and started a "hearty" gaming journey.

But, why did the `fps` drop below 30, what's going on?

Hey, I moved the laptop power cord, how did it shut down?

Okay, it turns out that it's out of power, I restarted and saw the power display as 0 below. So, I picked up my phone, played for a while, waited for it to charge, I remember it seemed like 20% would not enter power-saving mode, then the frame rate should go up (I didn't think too much at this time, because this gaming notebook has been used for nearly 5 years, and there has been no particular situation)

Well, after polling the laptop's power several times every five minutes, I finally started to suspect that there was a problem with my laptop. This is not just simply running out of power; so what is the problem, after all, if you want to search, you have to first locate the problem, and the problem here is "why can't the laptop be charged"

Browsing the top-ranked pages on Google...

Okay, most of them are telling me to replace the battery, please, don't be so direct~

Flipping through, I finally found a [pretty good article](http://www.8fe.com/jiaocheng/5943.html), one of the situations mentioned in it perfectly matches my current situation, and the solution is finally not as high-cost as replacing the battery:

> **### 2. Unable to Charge Due to Low Temperature**
>
> When the computer is connected to the power supply, it will display "Battery 0%, power is connected, charging", and it will shut down immediately after unplugging the power, indicating that the battery is out of power.
>
> Lithium batteries will not be able to be charged when they are close to zero degrees.
> 
> Solution: Put the notebook in the quilt for two or three hours, or use a hair dryer to heat the battery position (a few minutes will do).

Suddenly I remembered that many electrical appliances need to warm up if they haven't been used for a long time, and this computer really hasn't been used for a while, and the recent weather has also become colder, anyway, this method is worth a try!

How to try?

- Hairdryer? I don't think it's good, the computer is not pure metal, the hair dryer is easy to heat unevenly, pass
- Quilt? Where does the heat come from, do I warm the bed for it? pass
- Then I saw the hot water bag in my hand, good! It's you

In the end, the problem was perfectly solved, but the picture was a bit beautiful, with a hot water bag under the notebook...

After the event, the problem was solved, let's look at the reasons:

> The difficulty of charging lithium-ion batteries near zero degrees is mainly caused by two reasons. First, the working principle of lithium-ion batteries is to achieve charging and discharging by moving lithium ions between the positive and negative electrodes of the battery. When the temperature drops, the movement speed of lithium ions will slow down, which will lead to a decrease in battery charging efficiency. Second, the viscosity of the electrolyte inside the battery will increase at low temperatures, which will also hinder the movement of lithium ions. Under low-temperature conditions, the internal resistance of the battery will also increase, further affecting the charging efficiency. Therefore, lithium-ion batteries may not be able to be charged near zero degrees.
