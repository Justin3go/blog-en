# Look at the openai conference
## GPT-4 Turbo

### Context length

- GPT-4 supports up to 8k, in some cases up to 32k
- GPT-4 Turbo supports 128K tokens, equivalent to 300 standard pages

### More control

- Easier API calls: new features of the JSON mode, ensuring the model will respond with valid JSON
- Better function calls, multiple functions can be called at the same time:

- Reproducible outputs: you can pass a C parameter, it will make the model return consistent outputs, giving you more control over the model behavior
- View logs in the API (will be launched in the next few weeks)

### Better world knowledge

- Retrieval feature, can bring knowledge from external files
- GPT-4 Turbo training data is up to date as of April 2023

### New modality

- Dolly 3, GPT-4 Turbo with Vision and the new text-to-speech model all have APIs
- GPT-4 Turbo can now accept images as input through the API, outputting captions, classifications, analyses, etc.
- There are 6 preset voices, quite natural

### Customization

- Allows fine-tuning of 16K's 3.5
- GPT-4 fine-tuning has entered the application stage

### Rate limit

You can apply to change the rate limit and quota in the API account settings

### Pricing

> They promise not to use data from the API for training

Pricing: 3 times cheaper than GPT-4 for input words, twice cheaper for output words

Speed: GPT-4 Turbo has become faster

The web version of chatGPT has been optimized: no dropdown options, automatically selected based on your needs

## GPTs

GPTs is a customized version of chatGPT for specific purposes, you can build a GPT, a custom version of chatGPT for almost anything, combined as follows:

- Combined with computer science for teaching
- Canvas design
- Integration of 6000 applications, decided by GPT on which application to call

Intends to build a GPT mall (similar to an app store)

## Assistant API

- No need to handle long conversation history yourself
- Built-in retrieval, code interpreter, etc.
- Some advantages of GPT-4 Turbo
