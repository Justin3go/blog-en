# Explanation of Common Indicators and Methods for Stock Funds
## Foreword

Recently, I have been studying the basic knowledge related to stock funds and preparing to step into the world of investment. However, many calculation methods were involved in the process of learning, so I will simply organize them here.
## Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)

The calculation formula for the price-to-earnings ratio is: **P/E = Share price / Earnings Per Share (EPS)**

> Here, the share price refers to the total market value of the company divided by the total number of shares issued by the company, and the earnings per share refer to the net profit of the company divided by the total number of shares issued by the company.

Don't be afraid of such mathematical formulas, it is actually very simple. Understand what the formula represents and find that feeling, for example:

- The share price represents what we pay
- Earnings per share represent the profit we get
- This is a division, common divisions such as (total price / quantity = unit price), here is the same, it is the price that investors are willing to pay for each unit of profit

**The level of the P/E ratio can reflect the market's expectations of the company's future profitability**. Generally speaking, a higher P/E ratio may indicate that the market has higher expectations for the company's future profit growth, so it is willing to pay a higher price. Conversely, a lower P/E ratio may indicate that the market has lower expectations for the company's future profit growth.

Classification of P/E ratio: 

- Static P/E ratio: from the past year
- Rolling P/E ratio: from the past four quarters, updated every quarter
- Dynamic P/E ratio: forecast for the next year
- Shiller P/E ratio: use the average net profit from the past 10 years as the denominator, i.e., market value / average net profit from the past 10 years. Using 10 years of data means reducing the impact of occasional fluctuations.
- Median P/E ratio: a valuation indicator only found in indices, which ranks the constituent stocks of an index by P/E ratio from high to low and takes the one in the middle.

## Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B)

Let's start with the calculation formula: **P/B = Share price / Book value per share**

> Here, the share price refers to the total market value of the company divided by the total number of shares issued by the company, and the book value per share refers to the total assets of the company minus total liabilities, divided by the total number of shares issued by the company.

The difference from the P/E ratio is that `E` has been replaced with `B`, so as long as you understand the P/E ratio, you just need to understand the meaning of `B` (book value per share).

So the P/B ratio reflects the price investors are willing to pay for each unit of book value of the company. Generally speaking, a higher P/B ratio may indicate that the market has a higher valuation of the company and is willing to pay a higher price. Conversely, a lower P/B ratio may indicate that the market has a lower valuation of the company.

> Compared to the P/E ratio, the P/B ratio is more stable. Because profit is generated over a period of time, while net assets are accumulated.

## ROE

ROE=Net income/Equity.

The efficiency of a company's operations, compared to the P/E ratio, the P/B ratio is more stable. Because profit is generated over a period of time, while net assets are accumulated.

> If a company's profits have been 18% of capital for 20-30 years, even if the initial price was high, the return will still satisfy you.
> 
> The higher the ROE of a company, the higher the asset operation efficiency, and the higher the P/B ratio.

## Dividend Yield

The calculation formula for the dividend yield is: **Dividend Yield = Dividend Per Share / Share Price**

> Here, the dividend per share refers to the total dividends paid by the company over a certain period of time (usually a year) divided by the total number of shares issued by the company, and the share price refers to the total market value of the company divided by the total number of shares issued by the company.

By understanding the formula in the way above, it is easy to understand that the dividend yield is used to measure the percentage of the dividends paid by the company relative to its stock price. It is an important indicator for investors to evaluate investment returns and the company's dividend policy.

It's about how much I pay and how much dividends I can get

Dividends are a good way to hold equity assets for a long time and enjoy cash flow income at the same time.

## Payout Ratio

The payout ratio only differs from the dividend yield by one denominator:

The calculation formula for the payout ratio is: **Payout Ratio = Total Dividends / Net Income**

It is used to measure the extent to which a company distributes its profits to shareholders. It reflects the generosity of the company's dividend policy and can also help investors understand the company's profit distribution strategy.

## PEG

PEG, short for (Price/Earnings to Growth), is an indicator that measures stock price relative to company earnings growth. It is the ratio of the P/E ratio to the expected earnings growth rate, which can help investors evaluate the relative value of the company's stock while considering the company's earnings growth.

The calculation formula for PEG is: **PEG = P/E Ratio / Expected Earnings Growth Rate**

Here, the P/E ratio is the stock price divided by earnings per share, and the expected earnings growth rate is the earnings growth rate expected by investors for a future period (usually the next year).

Generally speaking, the PEG ratio can provide a more comprehensive perspective than the P/E ratio to evaluate the value of a stock. If a company's PEG ratio is less than 1, it may mean that the company's stock is undervalued, because its price is relatively low compared to earnings growth. Conversely, if the PEG ratio is greater than 1, it may mean that the company's stock is overvalued, because its price is relatively high compared to earnings growth.
## Cash Flow Yield

> If earnings remain unchanged, usually look at the cash flow yield

Cash Flow Yield = Cash Flow / Market Value.
## Earnings Yield Method

The earnings yield is a variant of the P/E ratio. The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market value by its earnings, while the earnings yield is calculated by dividing the company's earnings by its market value. In other words, the earnings yield is roughly the reciprocal of the P/E ratio.

The usage of the earnings yield method is as follows.

- Invest when the earnings yield of the index fund is greater than 10% and more than twice the yield of government bonds.
- Sell when the earnings yield is less than the expected return of the bond fund (currently 6.4%).

The earnings yield method is actually an application of the absolute valuation method.

In "Dollar Cost Averaging for Ten Years", it is explained as follows:

Earnings are the "cash flow" of index funds; market value is the "present value" of index funds.

So if you compare it like this, the earnings yield is the "discount rate" in the discount calculation formula. Graham's requirement to invest when the earnings yield is greater than 10% is a requirement for investors to have a discount rate greater than 10%.

This is the core of the earnings yield method: the absolute valuation method with a discount rate of 10%.
## Bogle's Formula Method

- For varieties with long-term earnings growth significantly higher than 10%, Bogle's formula method is suitable.
- PEG reflects the relationship between the fluctuation range of the P/E ratio and the long-term average earnings growth rate, and PEG is generally between 1-2. If the P/E ratio remains at a very high value for a long time, be cautious about these varieties, because few varieties can maintain a high earnings growth rate for a long time.
- On this basis, combined with the historical P/E ratio of the index, see where the current P/E ratio is in the historical P/E ratio. If the P/E ratio is also at a low level, this variety is likely to be undervalued, and it can be considered for purchase.
- If the P/E ratio is at a high level, or if the PEG is also greater than 2, then this variety is likely to be overvalued, and you should be more cautious at this time.
## Finally

In fact, it's nothing more than understanding the meaning of each variable in the formula, and then doing what kind of operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.), I recommend you can read "Underlying Logic 2", which talks about mathematics combined with life, many things can be expressed in mathematics.
