## Introduction

This part is mainly a summary and arrangement of the knowledge I have learned, which is more systematic and rich compared to the blog's tab, welcome everyone to read and comment, I am gradually organizing historical documents into this website, and there are some book notes.

+ Note 1: Some articles may have been written a long time ago and have not been updated. I just organized them. The workload to correct them one by one is too large, so if there are any problems, please comment, I will reply in time.
+ Note 2: Most of the articles in the notes are organized from other people's video tutorials, articles, books, due to historical reasons, many notes come from local uploads, the specific reference to that article is not recorded, so if the articles in the notes violate your copyright, please contact or comment in time; For the new articles in the future, I will indicate the source of the referenced online articles, video tutorial addresses, book names, etc...
